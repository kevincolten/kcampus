== Welcome to kCamp.us

kCamp.us (http://kCamp.us) is an education administration system that allows for 
the organization of students, teachers, administrators, courses and events. The 
organization structure and terminology used is based on my experience as an
instructor at Austin Community College, Austin, TX.

This is a work in progress, but feel free to poke around. Just don't panic if
you find a bug, or encounter an error, as I am pushing to this all the time to help correct
these issues.
